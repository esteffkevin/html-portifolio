<h1>About Me</h1>

  Howya! I'm Kevin Esteff, a passionate computer science enthusiast originally from Brazil and now soaking up the charm of Dublin for nearly five years. At 29, I've got a burning desire to pivot from hospitality to the dynamic world of technology. With a fervent love for computer science, I'm on a mission to transition into a tech role where I can leverage my enthusiasm and skills to make an impact. Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities together!
